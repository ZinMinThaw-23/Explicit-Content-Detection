I won't take 'em now, 'cause I have a toothache that hurts too a   Little bit. I've taken everything I got, been thinkin'   All that blood pressure medicine you take and stuff too.

That's probably why you have a headache, 'cause your pressure's up.   Yeah.   I don't know how you can forget to take it. And when that's the   Only pill you take   I'm sorry, I have so many pills you'd be surprised.   Well, the blood pressure pill is the most important one.   Yeah, I know   There ain't no other one as important as that one.   I got one more and then I gotta get to the store. I got two   Refills on it.   You only got one pill?!   I only take one a day   Well, yeah, but you shouldn't let 'em get that low   I guess not, but I can take one in the morning and then go get   Some more   They're expensive!

Well, that's the blood pressure pill The heart pill, the   Procardia. And what's the other one?   Ah, H-why-D-are-O-T-O-N.   Oh, that's something to do with water and And Water and, uh,   Blood pressure.   This one tag does say it's for blood pressure   Yeah, I think it works like a water pill type pressure, but the   Procardia's the important one.   Yeah.   You have to take that every day.   Yeah.   You should take that the first thing when you get up   YeahI know.   Well, how come you ain't got taken it?   I took it yesterday, the procardia.   Well, how come you didn't take it today?

Desperate men, desperate women divided,   Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.      Fortune calls.   I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,   Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.   She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,   On midsummer's eve, near the tower.      The cold-blooded moon.   The captain waits above the celebration   Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid   Whose ebony face is beyond communication.   The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.      They shaved her head.   She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.   A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.   I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,   Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.      I stumbled to my feet.   I rode past destruction in the ditches   With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.   Renegade priests and treacherous young witches   Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.      The palace of mirrors   Where dog soldiers are reflected,   The endless road and the wailing of chimes,   The empty rooms where her memory is protected,   Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.      She wakes him up   Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking   Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.   She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.   He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.      Gentlemen, he said,   I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,   I've moved your mountains and marked your cards   But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination   Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.      Peace will come   With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire   But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall   And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating   Between the King and the Queen of Swords.\n",

Here's adventure, here's romance,   Here's the famous Robbin Hood of the old west.      Cisco, the sheriff, he's getting closer!      This way Poncho, vominos. The Cisco Kid.      Way, way, way, we way back in the days the year, 1980.   Had to get a job, had to make some money-ney   Picked up a pen and a pad,   Dropped reality never thinking that I would live to see the day I'd rock my own CD      We used to do the dance we called obie-obie   Now S.T.P. 1993, so Hollywood get out my way   My mom's words seems like yesterday   \"Love Jesus, don't forget to pray\"   She most have gone with the boss D.J. Right?   (Don't be too sure of that fat one. Fat one?)   And feelin though, skinny coming with the 9mm      Cause he who has the money has the authority,   And respect to the man with the Uzi   (I'm pretty handy with a six gun myself)   The 808 kick is on my hit list   And this beat's cooking like an Ital Dish   It wasn't hard for me to do, it so easy   Because to me loops loops tight go naturally   Mom's words seem like yesterday.      What's your name? Cisco Kid.   Si, Poncho's name is, Poncho.      Now in '94 we got an S.T.P.   A half pack of smokes, and oh yes, and Sammy   A fifteen pack of Old Milwaukee   A dalmatian and a girlfriend,   But I ain't got no money-ne-ne-ne      The 808 is within my reach,   Sublime beats are comin' straight from long beach.   If you think that Hollywood   Didn't get what he deserved,   Call 808 kit to get served      (Scarface)   How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?      There's always some hombre that can't resist swapin' lead,   Just to see if their faster with the six gun than Cisco is.      They'll only find out Cisco is fastet.      Well that don't stop 'em from tryin' Poncho,   Like Slade here,   He fancies himself as fast on the draw as a quarter-horse   Takin' after a stray.      What's the matter? Can't the Cisco Kid talk for himself?   Is that how you got your reputation Cisco,   By havin' your partner build you up?      I make no claim to a reputation senor,   And no one has to talk for me.      The Cisco Kid, heh,.   The kid part fits you from the way you act.      I've meet with your kind before.   You a foolish hombre if you think he will not fight you.      Your making big talk for an hombre who will not fight.      You are wrong Slade,   I'll fight you any place, any time.   If there is a good reason.      Well here's a fist full of reasons!      Now you two quit that.      Just as soon as I finish off this Cisco Kid.      You are the one that is finished you faggot.      Is that a good punch?      Alright you two, that's enough,   Let him alone Cisco.      I won't forget this Cisco,   I'll take this up with you another time.      Any time hombre,   I'd be glad to accommodate you.      I'll make it soon Cisco.      Shit up cash, keep your mouth shut.      That's what I mean, Cisco,   You attract trouble like a fiddler attracts a square dance,   You understand why I don't want   You staying in this town?

Following my song line   Past bamboo shacks and shops   Behind a jitney packed like sardines,   With bananas piled on top.      I ran away from politics,   It's too bizarre at home.   Away I flew, tuned into Blue   \"Maybe Amsterdam or Rome\"      Awakened by a stewardess,   With Spain somewhere below.   On the threshold of adventure,   God I do love this job so.      So while I make my move   On the big board game   Up and down a Spanish highway,   Some things remain the same.   Girls meet boys   and the boys tease girls   I'm heading out this morning,   For the Far Side of the World.      Oh I believe in song lines   Obvious and not   I'd ridden them like camels   To some most peculiar spots.      They run across the oceans   Through mountains and saloons   And tonight out to the dessert   Where I sit atop this dune.      I was destined for this vantage point   Which is so far from the Sea   I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery      From Paris to Tunisia   Casablanca to Dakar   I was riding long before I flew   Through the wind and sand and stars.

A Sunset framed by lightening bolts   Burns a lasting memory   And a string of tiny twinkling lights   adorn the sausage tree.   While the embers from the log fire   Flicker, fly, and twirl   Then drift off toward the cosmos   From the Far Side of the World.   Well it's Christmas and my birthday   and so to that extent   The Masai not the wise men   Are circling my tent.   I teach them how to play guitar   They show me how to dance   We have rum from the Caribbean   And Burgundy from France.      New Year's Eve in Zanzibar   With Babu and his boys   High up on the rooftop   You can relish all the noise.      They are dancing on the tables   People bouncing like gazelles   Two 0-0-1 is ushered in   With air raid horns and bells.      Time to sing time to dance   Living out my second chance.      Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled   That's the way it happens   On the Far Side of the World.      Back at home, it's afternoon   Six thousand miles away.   I will still be there when I get through   Attending this soiree      There are jobs and chores and questions   And plates I need to twirl,   But tonight I'll take my chances,   On the Far Side of the World.

Now I've paid my dues 'cause I have owed them, But I've paid a price sometimes   For being such a stubborn woman, In such stubborn times   I have run from the arms of lovers, I have run from the eyes of friends   I have run from the hands of kindness, I have run just because I can.      Now I've grown and I speak like a woman, And I see with a woman's eyes   And an open door is to me now, Like the saddest of goodbyes   Well it's too late for turning back, And I pray for the heart and nerve   .   Chorus: (repeat chorus)      I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon   I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher to be my guide.\n",

It wasn't easy going then.   There were times I almost threw that old towel in,   But you kept callin' me back to the stage,   And I finally found my place in each and every face.      I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.   There's still things that I want to say and do.   I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.   And just know that I'll always remember you.      When I first set out on the road, I figured   I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.   Well, it's goin' on thirty now   And I still love it just as much as I ever did.   When I hear that announcer say my name,   And I walk through those curtains   And see your smilin' faces,   My feet don't touch the ground again   Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.   I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,   But I figure a few.   I do want you to know, though,   That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,   And I'm all settled in, away from all this,   You won't be far away.   I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.   And I'll always remember you.      I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.   'Cause there's still things that I want to say and do.   I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.   And just know that I'll always remember you.      You've pulled me through some hard times.   Hope I've pulled you through a few.

            "Existence is a stage on which we pass   a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:   it's hopeless, I know,   but onward I must go   and try to make a start   at seeing something more than day to day   survival, chased by final death   if I believed this the sum   of the life to which we've come,   I wouldn't waste my breath   Somehow, there must be more. There was a time   when more was felt than known   but now, entrenched inside my sett,   in light more mundane,   thought rattles round my brain:   we live, we die...and yet?      In the beginning there was order and destiny   but now that path has reached the border,   and on our knees   is no way to face the future, whatever it be.   Though the forces which hold us in place   last through eons in unruffled grace   we, too, wear the face of creation.      As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically   the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,   all space is living history.   It seems as though time must betray us,   yet we're alive   and though I see no God to save us,   yetl we survive   through the centuries of progress   which don't get us very far.   All illusion! All is bogus -   we don't yet know what we are...   Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man!   with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,   we're grains of sand   and though, in time, the sea   may claim us for its own   we are the rocks which root the future -   on us it grows!      We might not be there to share it   if eternity's a jest   but I think that I can bear it   if the next life is the best.   Even if there is a heaven when we die,   endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie   that always comes as answer to the question,   \"Why do we see through the eyes of creation?\"      Adrift without a course,   it's very lonely here,   our only conjecture   what lies behind the dark.   Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,   think of a lifetime which means more   than my own one -   dreams of a grander thing than we are.   Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:   when all life is over who can say   no mutated force shall remain?   Though the towers of the city are denied   to we men of clay   still we know we shall scale   the heights some day.   Frightened in the silence -   frightened, but thinking very hard,   let us make computations of the stars.      Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:   faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:   colour blisters, image splinters gravitate   towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,   The universe now beckons   and Man, too, must take His place...   just a few last fleeting seconds   to wander in the waste,   and the children who were ourselves move on,   reincarnation stills its now perfected song,   and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.      All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies   and slavers too,   all the throng who have danced a merry tune -   human we can all be,   but Humanity we must rise above,   in the name of all faith and hope and love.   There's a time for all pilgrims,   and a time for the fakers too,   there's a time when we all will stand alone   and nude,   naked to the galaxies -   naked, but clothed in the overview...   as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew.      And though dark is the highway,   and the peak's distance breaks my heart,   for I never shall see it, still I play my part,   believing that what waits for us   is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past...   In the death of mere humans life shall start\n",

Ice in the rigging and howling wind,      Shock to my body   As we tumbled in, mercy from God.   My brothers and the others   Are lost at sea,      I alone am returned to tell thee.   Hidden in ice for a century to walk   The world again, Lord have mercy   On the frozen man.      Next words that were spoken to me,   Nurse asked me what my name might be.   She was all in white   At the foot of my bed,      I said angel of mercy   I'm alive or am I dead?   My name is William James McPhee,   I was born in 1843.      Raised in Liverpool by the sea   But that ain't who I am,   Lord have mercy   On the frozen man.      It took a lot of money   To start my heart,   To peg my leg and to buy my eye.

Another Halloween   People on Military know what this means   Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars   Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars   I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block   Spit in my face and gave my a rock   I tried to give it back and said \"I'll take nothing instead\"   Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head   Walked to the next house directly next door   There I saw an old lady dead on the floor   I said \"Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?\"   She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet   I ran to the next house happy and giddy   And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty   I said, \"Trick-or-treat.\" she sad \"Treat-or-trick.\"   And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick   Next house up was sittin back in the woods   I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods   I knocked on the door I heard a knock back   And then I heard \"COME ON IN\" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT   This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon   She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon   I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut   A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts   I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst   And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst   I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home   Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone   I walked throught the field, and to the next crib   Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib   I said \"How bout some candy.\" she said How bout instead,   A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread   My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb   And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb   I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat   I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street   Now my bag of candy has doubled in size   Up to the next house for my scary prize   I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick   He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit   Rock through his window and ran across the street   To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat   I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler   A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker   I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack   He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back   It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready   But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny   The next house is abandonded so forget it   But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it   I ran up to the door \"Trick-or-treat, you can't hide\"   It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died   The next house is mine the last on the block   My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock   I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady   And we yelled \"HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!\" to the whole city   (Chorus til fade)\n",

All the little kiddies love the dead body man.   I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell.   Some people run cause they don't like the smell.   Others line up just as quick as they can.   To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man.   It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh.....   Just don't look in the trunk.   I drive down central kickin' the bass.   Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face.   Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head.   Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead.   I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut.   A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut.   Riding in the back is my dead body crew.   Only they can never think of nothin' to do.   If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself.   You got dead deer heads up on your shelf.   On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand.   I'm just the dead body man.      \"We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people,   or you yourself are planning on dying soon,   we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!   We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!\"      Call me the dead body man (Some'll give 'em to me!)   Call me the dead body man (Just sell 'em to me!)   Call me the dead body man (You can mail 'em to me!)

People on the street,   They panic and start running.   Words on loose leaf,   Sheet complete coming.   I jump on my mind,   I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.   Healing the blind,   I promise to let the sun in.   Sick of the dark ways,   We march to the drumming.   Jump when they tell us   They want to see jumping.   Fuck that, I want to   See some fist pumping.   Risk something.   Take back what's yours   Say something that you know   They might attack you for   'Cause I'm sick of being treated   Like I had before.   Like it's stupid standing for   What I'm standing for.   Like this war is really just   A different brand of war.   Like it doesn't cater the rich   And an abandon the poor.   Like they understand you   In the back of the jet,   When you can't put gas in your tank.   These fuckers are laughing their way   To the bank and cashing their check   Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.      For a leader so nervous   In an obvious way   Stuttering and mumbling   For nightly news to replay   And the rest of the world   Watching at the end of the day   In the living room laughing   Like what did he say?      Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen      In my living room watching,   But I am not laughing.   'Cause when it gets tense,   I know what might happen.   The world is cold,   The bold men take action.   Have to react,   Or get blown into fractions.   Ten years old is something to see,   Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,   Taken and bound and found later under a tree,   I wonder if he thought the \"next one could be me\".   Do you see?   The soldiers they're out today.   That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.   It's ironic,   At times like this you pray,   But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.   There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,   Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,   My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know   But enough pride inside not to let that show.   My brother had a book he would hold with pride   A little red cover with a broken spine.   In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,   When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.      Meanwhile, the leader just talks away   Stuttering and mumbling   For nightly news to replay   And the rest of the world   Watching at the end of the day   Both scared and angry   Like what did he say?      Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.      With hands held high   Into a sky so blue   As the ocean opens up   To swallow you.

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.   I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.   Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.   I'm trying to do better than good enough.      [Chorus]   What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.   But people I don't have the time to hang with,   Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)   You promised me you would never change.   You promised me you would never change.      Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.   When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.   Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.   I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.   I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.   And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.   But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,   That I barley know at all and,   Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected   Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.   The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.   Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,   I'm holding on by a thread it's,   Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,   And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.   That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,   'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.      [Chorus]      Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.   The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.   Which made me question when I went missing.   And when I start treating my friends different.   Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.   Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.   Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.   Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.   I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.   I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.   Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.   Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.   Did I just trade free time for camera time?   Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?   I just need some closure.   Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.\n",

They said you looked lost on the dance floor,   With a lonely look in your eyes.   Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know   For once I wish I hadn't thought twice.   Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado,   And I headed out to Tennessee.   Heard you got married and you moved back home,   Here we are again, you and me.      It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,   Shines like the ring on your hand.   Annie, I owe you a dance.      Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye,   Yeah loves, I've had a few.   I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,   But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you.   Remember how we'd talk for hours, keeping each other's secrets,   Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,   But Annie I didn't keep it.   Almost called you up, when I played it bolder,   But I thought I'd just let it be.   Heard you found yourself a real good man,   Do you ever think of you and me?      It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,   Shines like the ring on your hand.   Annie, I owe you a dance.      So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking   Like I should have twenty years ago.   And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure,   And there's a song on the radio.   You give me your hand and we start to dance,   The cashier gives us a smile.   As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say   \"Momma, who was that guy?\"   I shouldn't be surprised, look forgiveness in your eyes,   Gave me a second chance.   Annie, thanks for the dance.\n",
